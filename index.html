        <p>
            Hello there, I was Born on June 8th, 1992. Raised in 
            Morristown, NJ and moved to charlotte, NC in 2009. I am bilingual 
            and speak spanish very fluently. My parents both being from Honduras
            I consider myself to be a hardworking and intelligent individual 
            who's just trying to make a career for myself.
                I currently work as a manager at GreenStar
                Pallet and Recyling. We're a 3rd party logistics
                for CHEP. I've been with the company for about 6
                years now it's been good to me so far and I
                appreciate the oppurtunity it's given me. However,
                it is not something I want to do forever. I've
                always been interested in technology and programs
                and just how they work and how it's created. I
                thought to myself this bootcamp would be a great
                way to dive into this new world, and I haven't 
                been disappointed yet! My goal is to be a free 
                lance sofware developer.</p>
