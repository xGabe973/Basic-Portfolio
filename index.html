            Hello there. My name is Gabriel Alvarado. I was Born on June 8th, 1992 and raised in 
            Morristown, NJ and moved to charlotte, NC in 2009. I am bilingual 
            and speak spanish very fluently. My parents are both from Honduras.
            I consider myself to be a hardworking and intelligent individual 
            who's just trying to make a career for myself.
                I currently work as a manager at GreenStar
                Pallet and Recyling working about 60 hours a week.
                We're a 3rd party logistics
                for CHEP. I've been with the company for about 6
                years now, it's been good to me so far and I
                appreciate the oppurtunity it's given me. However,
                it is not something I want to do forever.
                <br> 
                I've always been interested in technology and programs
                and just how they work and how it's created. I
                thought to myself this bootcamp would be a great
                way to dive into this new world, and I haven't 
                been disappointed yet! This class has been challenging
                so far but it's what I expected when I signed up. They
                don't call it bootcamp for nothing. I'm confident that
                when I graduate I'll have the problem solving skills that I need
                to tackle the industry.
